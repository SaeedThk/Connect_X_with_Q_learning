### Intro

Due to developments in AI and machine learning, playing board games against AI opponents has grown in popularity in recent years. A more realistic and interesting experience can be had by using AI-powered game engines, which can present players with powerful opponents that can adjust to various play styles. AI agents may also go through a massive amount of game data to find patterns and methods that humans might not have noticed. Both humans and AI agents may benefit from better gaming as a result of this. Nowadays it’s possible to explore strategy and tactics in a competitive setting thanks to the emergence of AI-powered board game opponents, and it will be interesting to see how this trend develops in the future.

One of the most popular two-player strategy game for decades is Connect Four [1]. The goal of the game, which is played on a 6x7 board, is to line up four of your own colored discs in a row in any direction before your opponent does the same. The game is a favorite of both competitive and casual players since it is easy to learn but offers a great lot of depth in terms of strategy.

A Connect Four learning AI bot can be developed using reinforcement learning (RL). A combination of supervised and unsupervised learning can be used to train the agent to predict game states depending on the state of the board and the player’s move. The agent can also gain knowledge by self-play, in which it competes with a replica of itself to develop a better strategy over time. To increase its chances of winning the game, the agent can use RL to improve its decision-making process and learn from experience.

### Background
#### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that teaches an agent how to operate in a given environment in a way that will maximize a reward signal. The agent picks up new skills by trial and error, experimenting with various behaviors and analyzing the results, then modifying its behavior over time to maximize the reward
